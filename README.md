# The JavaScript Number Guessing Game
This project implements a classic number guessing game using JavaScript.

## Features:
Generates a random number within a specified range.
Provides hints to the user ("Too High", "Too Low", or "Correct").
Tracks the number of guesses taken.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:
Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.

## Running the Game:
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Enter your desired guess range (e.g., 1-100) and click "Start Game".
Guess the randomly generated number by entering your guesses and clicking "Guess".
The game will provide hints and track your attempts.

## Files:

index.html: Contains the HTML structure and references the JavaScript file.
script.js: Implements the game logic using JavaScript.

## Future Enhancements:

Implement difficulty levels with varying number ranges and guess limits.
Add a "New Game" button to restart without refreshing the page.
Track and display the highest score.

### Note:

This project uses Math.random() for generating random numbers. While it works well for basic games, it's not cryptographically secure. Consider more advanced libraries for production-level applications.
Enjoy playing!
