# The JavaScript Number Guessing Game
This project implements a classic number guessing game using JavaScript.

## Features:
1. Generates a random number within a specified range.
2. Provides hints to the user ("Too High", "Too Low", or "Correct").
3. Tracks the number of guesses taken.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:
Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.

## Running the Game:
1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2. Enter your desired guess range (e.g., 1-100) and click "Start Game".
3. Guess the randomly generated number by entering your guesses and clicking "Guess".
4. The game will provide hints and track your attempts.

## Files:

1. index.html: Contains the HTML structure and references the JavaScript file.
2. script.js: Implements the game logic using JavaScript.

## Future Enhancements:

1. Implement difficulty levels with varying number ranges and guess limits.
2. Add a "New Game" button to restart without refreshing the page.
3. Track and display the highest score.

### Note:

This project uses Math.random() for generating random numbers. While it works well for basic games, it's not cryptographically secure. Consider more advanced libraries for production-level applications.
Enjoy playing!
